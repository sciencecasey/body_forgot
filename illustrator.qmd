Joey Highshoe is a Los Angeles-based illustrator who rediscovered his childhood love of drawing while working on *The Body Forgot*. As the cousin of the author, Casey Jayne, Joey felt inspired to take a crack at illustrating this important story. Although it had been nearly 15 years since Joey last picked up a sketchbook, the story’s message about empathy and understanding was too powerful to resist. Self-taught and fueled by creativity, Joey hopes his colorful illustrations will help kids see that kindness and character matter most of all.
