# About the Book

Rohan is a bright child who wants to introduce you to his many disabled friends.  By joining Rohan to visit his neighbors we see that not all bodies work the same way, but the quality of someone’s character is the most important thing.  Rohan models what it means to be a friend to those with different needs and teaches about accommodations used by each person.  

Written by an author with a number of complex chronic conditions, The Body Forgot exposes children to invisible disabilities such as bowel disease, chronic pain, inflammatory skin conditions, hearing loss, diabetes, and chronic fatigue in an age-appropriate way.
