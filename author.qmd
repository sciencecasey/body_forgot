After years living with fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, MCAS, and long covid, I felt compelled to try and explain to my young nieces why I could never see them for very long before needing to go lie down.  With the help of my talented cousin, Joey Highshoe, we wrote “The Body Forgot” attempting to demystify common symptoms of chronic illness in an age-appropriate, fun way.  Disabled people have much value to offer the children in their lives and it is my hope that this book helps children understand that not all bodies work the same way- and that’s okay!   I didn’t want another sad book about how a person lost this or that ability, but instead one that celebrates the *strengths* of the chronically ill while accepting their needs for extra rest, mobility aids, technological support, or special diets.
